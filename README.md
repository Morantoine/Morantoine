I'm an engineering student at ENSIMAG, in cryptography and cybersecurity master.

- I've always been fond of theorical and applied mathematics as well as computer science üßÆ
- Currently specializing in cryptography üîí (linear codes, provable security, quantum/post-quantum crypto...).
- Strengthening skills in networking and cybersecurity üíª.
- I've also been providing IT technical support to all the students of ENSIMAG as a member of the School's *Bugbusters* üßë‚Äçüíª.

Some projets I've worked on :
  - Use of NLP AI techniques for machine logs factorization (as part of an internship at [LIG Research Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratoire_d%27Informatique_de_Grenoble)).
  - Implementation of accelerated AES key enumeration on GPU (as part of a collaboration with [CEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Alternative_Energies_and_Atomic_Energy_Commission)).
